	<h5 class="text-left"><b>the vision</b></h5>
	<br>
	<p>
		the project vision is to explore how i might use entertainment technology to connect people remotely to tackle the increase social isolation and loneliness which prevailed during and after the covid-19 pandemic - paying particular attention to the reality that relationship and families of all sizes, shapes and backgrounds were unable to see each other in person and lost so much as a result.

					<h5 class="text-left"><b>what did i do?</b></h5>
					<p>
						i was the sole ux designer/researcher on this project, conducting everything from research to usability tests and creating prototypes from low fidelity paper prototypes to digital, interactive hi-fi designs. i was responsible for the invention of this product and determining the overall design direction, while communicating with my lecturer and peers to gain feedback on my work.
					</p>
					<h5 class="text-left"><b>desk research</b></h5>
					<p>
						i searched through scholarly articles focused on mental health during covid-19, particularly for the military and frontline workers. i wanted to explore the challenges faced by people who are often separated from their loved ones due to their taxing jobs and distance, and who may rely on technology or not have time for communication. i also researched the importance of handwritten letters for these individuals and wanted to explore ways to make the process more efficient, creative, and accessible.

						</li>
						<li>
							as a family member of a front-line worker - i'd like to easily keep in touch with my loved one who mightn't have easy access to their phone or be able to text or call all the time
						</li>
						<li>
							as a soldier serving a tour abroad - i'd like to keep close connections with my partner and family so i feel as though i'm in the loop as being away from home for a long period of time makes me feel isolated and alone in the world

						the empathy map is to gain a better understanding of the users in the usability tests conducted. this is to gain a better sense of empathy, look and see how a person feels, look into what they say during the tests, what do they do, what is their boy language like and how do they think?

					<p>
						with the affinity diagram, you take all the sticky notes from the empathy map and divide them up into different headings. the headings aren't preplanned - if different sticky notes look like they connect with each other you put them in the same pile. afterwards, you get the headings of the main problems you need to solve based on the user feedback from interviews.

					<p>
						for mid-fi, i started looking into how the app for function, how the animations would look in really bringing this product to life. i kept the user in mind when designing and even though there was no colour or textures - i still wanted to make it feel real. 
					</p>
					<b class="text-left">iterations of mid-fi prototype based on feedback</b>
					<ul>
						<li>due to user feedback - i'll incorporate instructions to the letter writing process in 
							the beginning to make it easier for new users to navigate the application - this will also include 
							an i (information) button where the user has an option to click on if they're stuck  </li>
						<li>i added an option now for the user to edit their profile due to user feedback of editing 
							the profile to make them more customisable. i'll think of way of developing this idea to 
							make it more appealing to users. </li>
