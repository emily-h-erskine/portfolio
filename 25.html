	<br>
	<p>
		we want to build the ultimate home for 25 - an online version of the game that is great for beginners and veterans alike. a haven where beginners can learn, safe in the knowledge that they will not have obscenities screamed at them for playing the wrong card at the wrong time. and then the others - those who are experts and those that think they are experts! we will be offering members an online place to learn and play on any internet connected phone, tablet or pc.

				<h5 class="text-left"><b>what did i do?</b></h5>
				<p>
					i was the sole ux designer/researcher on this project, conducting everything from research to usability tests and creating prototypes from low fidelity paper prototypes to digital, interactive hi-fi designs. i was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while communicating with my lecturer and peers to gain feedback on my work.
				</p>
				<h5 class="text-left"><b>desk research</b></h5>
				<p>
					as part of our desk research, we had to teach others how to play the game, this is to show how you'd create a tutorial when designing the game. so, it's accessible to beginners and advanced player alike.

				<h5 class="text-left"><b>stakeholder interview findings</b></h5>
				<p>
					it was evident from the stakeholder interview that there was great scope for creativity. the stakeholder said that the skies the limit, we also weren't designing for just one audience but multiple. we had to cater for a wide range of abilities and ages, with the aim of making the application engaging for all.

						i am a 40-year-old native of sligo - currently working in sidney. who would love to reengage with friends by our weekly game of 25, using my mobile phone.
					</li>
					<li>
						i am a high-school student from boston - who's granny is from and lives in donegal. Would love to bond with her by learning her favourite game 25, so she can play it with her when she sees her this christmas.
					</li>
					<li>
						we are a group of students (from all over the world) with a mutual love of ireland and the irish culture. we would like to meet new friends and play 25 in a safe and comfortable manor online using our mobile phones.

				<br>for hi-fi, I colourised the prototype - making the contents livelier. adding colour to the mascot, and gradients to the background giving setting to the prototype and adding to the general atmosphere. the aim of creating a fun, welcoming game at heart.
				<br><br>when you want to save the game of 25, you must appeal to the audience and to appeal to the young generations - who will ultimately save the game and pass it down when they're older. hence the fun-loving cartoon like atmosphere.
